<h2 class="title is-4">Description of Project</h2>

Sencha Test is used by developers and QA engineers to create and run unit and end-to-end tests on their Javascript applications.

<h2 class="title is-4">My Role</h2>

As the Product Design Lead at Sencha, my role was to oversee all user experience and visual design for Sencha Test. I worked closely with product managers and developers to solve complex problems that related to the Javascript testing space.

<h2 class="title is-4">Goals</h2>

Create a clear and easy to navigate interface.
Develop new concepts to help QA engineers write reusable tests.
Create an easy product set-up and activation system.

<h2 class="title is-4">Getting Started</h2>

For the most recent release of Sencha Test we were able to implement new design concepts that created a friendly, sleek, and meaningful interface.

In order to support customers who could not access our license server due to a security fire wall, we had to create a work flow which allowed users to upload a license file they received via email.

Sencha test was built for two personas: Test Engineers who create end-to-end test for full applications, and Developers who create unit tests as they build applications. Choosing a role will customize certain options within the interface to allow each persona quickly create and write tests for their specific needs.

The project selection screen is normally the first screen a user will see on launch of Sencha Test. From this screen users can create new projects, open existing projects, find resources, and view recently opened projects.

<h2 class="title is-4">Building Tests</h2>

Traditionally Test Engineers build suites of test by writing Javascript code using a framework such as Jasmine. While Sencha Test utilizes the power of Jasmine, we have taken it a step further and created an interface to help build and manage stable reusable test code.

In order to help make writing and managing test suites easier we have developed a feature we call "tree view."  In tree view Sencha Test creates a visual representation of actual test code, allowing users to work on individual test steps one at a time. users also have drag and drop ability built in to Tree View so they can easily reorder and reuse test steps.
